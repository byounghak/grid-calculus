## Where the project stands

**Phase 0 — Project scaffold is done.** PR #1 merged into `main` on 2026-05-01 (Ubuntu GCC + Ubuntu Clang both green; locally spot-checked on Apple Clang via Homebrew). The repository now has a buildable skeleton: CMake 3.20+ project, Eigen 3.4.0 + GoogleTest v1.14.0 pinned in `cmake/Dependencies.cmake`, full `include/gridcalc/{core,tensor,stencil,diff,spectral,func,solve}/` placeholder tree, `gridcalc::version()` shim returning `"0.0.1"`, `.clang-format` / `.clang-tidy` / `CMakePresets.json`, GitHub Actions CI on Ubuntu, and the proprietary LICENSE.

**Repository:** [github.com/byounghak/grid-calculus](https://github.com/byounghak/grid-calculus) — **private**. Local `main` tracks `origin/main` over SSH (`git@github.com:byounghak/grid-calculus.git`). Two commits pushed:

- `docs: add initial constitution and workflow specs` (`mission`, `tech-stack`, `roadmap`, `CLAUDE`, `STATUS`)
- `chore: add .gitignore for build artifacts, doc outputs, editor clutter`

**License:** Proprietary. All rights reserved by the author; no open-source license. The `LICENSE` file added in Phase 0 will carry an "All rights reserved" notice rather than a permissive license. Mission/scope unchanged: production / industrial use, distributed to authorized recipients only.

## What's in `specs/`

- [mission.md](mission.md) — purpose, audience (production/industrial materials science), quality bar, in/out-of-scope.
- [tech-stack.md](tech-stack.md) — C++17 + Eigen + GoogleTest + Google Benchmark + PocketFFT (verification only) + OpenMP. CMake 3.20+. Docs: Doxygen + LaTeX User Guide (memoir) + Developer Note (book) → PDFs only (no Sphinx, no public HTML site since the repo is private).
- [roadmap.md](roadmap.md) — 23 phases, 0 through 22. Phase 0 = project scaffold; Phase 21 = cross-platform CI hardening; Phase 22 = v1.0 release.
- [CLAUDE.md](CLAUDE.md) — feature workflow runbook. Auto-loaded by Claude Code in this directory.
- `STATUS.md` — this file.

## Next action

**Phase 1 — Periodic 3D scalar grid + Laplacian.** Per `CLAUDE.md`, the entry point is:

1. Open branch `YYYY-MM-DD-phase-1-laplacian` (use today's date when starting).
2. Use `AskUserQuestion` to pin down API choices (signatures for `Grid` / `Field` / `IndexPolicy::Periodic`, default accuracy order, naming, test-data choice for the convergence sweep).
3. Create `specs/YYYY-MM-DD-phase-1-laplacian/{plan,requirements,validation}.md`.
4. Implement: `core/Grid.hpp`, `core/Field.hpp`, `core/IndexPolicy.hpp`, `stencil/CentralDifference.hpp`, `diff/Laplacian.hpp`, plus the convergence test on $\sin(k_x x)\sin(k_y y)\sin(k_z z)$.

**Acceptance** (from `roadmap.md` Phase 1): Laplacian of $\sin(\mathbf{k}\cdot\mathbf{x})$ recovers $-|\mathbf{k}|^2$ times the input; halving $h$ reduces error by 4× (log-log slope ≈ 2).

A scheduled follow-up agent (`trig_01M1NGo52vJhJEjx4NyvoEdf`) will check in on 2026-05-22 to decide whether to file a tracking issue for Phase 21.

## Decisions worth knowing (encoded in the specs but easy to miss)

- **Gradients are reported in Cartesian** regardless of lattice basis. Lattice geometry is an implementation detail of `Grid`. (Locked in Phase 15.)
- **Unified mixing-by-default differentiation on multi-atom-basis grids.** At a site of sublattice α, gradients pull contributions from all nearby sites regardless of sublattice. The decoupled per-sublattice mode is opt-in via a policy tag. Weights are derived per `(α, derivative, accuracy)` by generalized finite differences (Taylor-moment matching). (Phase 16.)
- **Functional API for high-rank data** must use contraction expression templates (Phases 11 and 14) to avoid materializing rank-6 intermediate tensors (3⁶ = 729 components/point for a 4th-order gradient of rank-2 data).
- **FFT is verification only** — never the production differentiation engine, never a solver. PocketFFT, header-only, behind `-DGRIDCALC_USE_FFT=ON` (default on). The CI cross-check between FD and FFT operators is a permanent gate from Phase 9 onward.
- **Documentation toolchain split.** User Guide = `memoir` class (typography); Developer Note = `book` class because `doxygen.sty` conflicts with `memoir` on `\hangpara` / `\hangparas` and several preamble packages. `pdflatex` is locked. **Sphinx was dropped** when the repo went private — PDFs are now the only narrative-documentation output, and the "Hello grid" content moved into the User Guide as a chapter (was originally planned as a Sphinx page).
- **Repository visibility: private; license: proprietary.** No open-source license; redistribution requires authorization. `LICENSE` file added in Phase 0 will be an "All rights reserved" notice. There is no public docs hosting; PDFs ship as private-repo release assets only. Mission target ("production / industrial") is unchanged.
- **Phase 0 ships Linux-only CI.** The original roadmap acceptance bar for Phase 0 listed all four compiler families (GCC, Clang, Apple Clang, MSVC). Decided in the Phase 0 spec round to narrow that to Ubuntu GCC + Ubuntu Clang for cheaper iteration, and to insert a new **Phase 21 — Cross-platform CI hardening** before the v1.0 release phase (which moved to Phase 22). The full four-family compiler-support matrix in `tech-stack.md` is unchanged — it just isn't enforced in CI until Phase 21. Known accumulated-portability-bug risk recorded in `roadmap.md` "Risks to watch."
- **`byounghak/atomic-structure` integration deferred to Phase 15+.** Considered importing the existing private library [`atomic-structure`](https://github.com/byounghak/atomic-structure) (v1.6.0; locally at `/Users/byounghak/Projects/KMC refactor/Atomic structure`) as the backing implementation of Phase 1's `Grid`. Decided against: Phase 1 is Cartesian-orthogonal only and a 30-line in-house struct is the right weight; atomic-structure's `Box` + `Crystal` + `Structure` map naturally onto **Phase 15 (non-orthogonal Bravais)** and **Phase 16 (multi-atom basis)** instead. Integration approach (replace `Grid` internals vs. consume `Structure` directly) is decided in the Phase 15 spec round. Recorded as an Implementation note under both Phase 15 and Phase 16 deliverables in `roadmap.md`.
- **Code style.** Leading-underscore member vars (`_lattice`, never `_Capital` or `__double`); camelCase verb-prefixed methods (`getX`, `isY`, `findZ`, `buildW`); snake_case struct fields; PascalCase types; STL-protocol carve-out (`begin`/`end`/`size`/`empty`/`data`/`swap` keep canonical names as 1-line shims that delegate to the verb-prefixed accessor).
- **Compiler tier.** GCC, Clang, Apple Clang, MSVC are all blocking-CI tier-1. The "Windows best-effort" line in `tech-stack.md` is a support-priority statement, not a CI demotion.

## Open / deferred items

- **Eigen unsupported tensor module risk.** May fall back to in-house `Tensor3` / `Tensor4` if `Eigen::TensorFixedSize` doesn't build cleanly across the compiler matrix. Decision deferred until Phase 13 (vector/tensor fields) actually uses it.

## How to resume in a new session

A fresh Claude Code session in this directory auto-loads `CLAUDE.md`. Read this `STATUS.md` first to get current state, then tell Claude: *"Continue from the next phase per STATUS.md."* Claude should run the `CLAUDE.md` runbook from step 1.

When a phase completes, update this file:

1. Move the phase row to "Done" (add a new section if you want to track completion dates).
2. Bump the **Last updated** date.
3. Add any new decisions that emerged to "Decisions worth knowing."
4. Resolve any closed items from "Open / deferred."
